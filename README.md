# Excel Coffee Sales Project

### Project Overview
This guided data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of coffee beans from a company over a 4-year timeframe. This project focused on utilizing Microsoft Excel to understand the data process and apply analysis techniques. The primary goal was to analyze a dataset, extract meaningful insights, and present the findings in an organized and interpretable manner.

### Data Source
Sales Data: The dataset used for this project is the "CoffeeOrdersProject.csv" file, which was obtained from [here](https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx).

### Tools
- Excel (Vlookup, Index, Match, If statements, Pivot Tables) 

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
- **VLOOKUP:** Used to fill out customer data in the orders table.
- **Index, Match:** Used to fill out product data.
- **Logical Functions:** Used IF() statements to handle empty data values.
- Improved general formatting (Changed date format and included units for the 'size' column)

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This project aimed to answer these key questions:
1. What is the overall sales trend?
2. Which coffee types are top sellers?
3. Which roast type is the most popular?

### Data Analysis
Created PivotTables to summarize and analyze the sales data and organized everything into a dashboard.

### Results Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. A general sales trend was difficult to identify. Coffee bean orders seemed to peak every 2-3 months, which indicates how often consumers replace orders.
2. Excelsa was the most popular coffee type overall, followed by Arabica, Liberica, and Robusta. This trend tends to deviate at different roast types and sizes.
3. Overall, the most popular roast type was Light roast, followed by Medium and Dark roasts.
   
### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
- Offer promotions and discounts during off-peak months.
- Improve benefits to the loyalty card program to incentivize more customers to join and increase sales.
- Invest in marketing to other countries to increase global sales.

### Limitations
The analysis was constrained by the quality and completeness of the available data. Any inaccuracies, missing values, or biases within the dataset may have impacted the results and conclusions.
